                  While Cadina AI aims to help you create better resumes, I cannot guarantee job interviews, offers, or employment outcomes.
                  Job search success depends on many factors beyond resume quality. I am not responsible for any job rejections,
                  missed opportunities, or employment-related decisions made by employers.
